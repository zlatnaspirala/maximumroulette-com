#### Created by Nikola Lukic
#### Almost all of represent projects/demos are open source done at night shift.

I have idea to synthesize all my project intro one corresponding system.
Every single project need more modularity for much easier reusable access.

If you look something from public server and you dont see it here you can find at:
Ussually apps/ folder because apps are standalone projects and no need to make copy
here. Just find it on https://github.com/zlatnaspirala?tab=repositories .

All repos from this list are active dev stage!
This repo corespond with:

### `visual-ts-game-engine`

### `nidza.js`
Source: https://github.com/zlatnaspirala/nidza
Npm: `npm i nidza`
2d canvas engine - Scene Object oriented engine with option smart update system. Events works on indentity level(canvas dom element). Nidza is exclusively for draws staff. Objective is CPU low price of usage. You can move object or start any animation but on finish there is no any draw calls. This is main objective task to make autoupdater with releasing on target/object reach. Project object is also adding all of kind composition video/webcam/images/text in same time and place.

### `Matrix-Engine`
Source: https://github.com/zlatnaspirala/matrix-engine
Npm: `npm i matrix-engine`
The benefits of this project is offering an overview of the entire application logic, easy native implementations (hybrid app), object structural. Thanks to Mr.Keestu i use (gl-program-structure) new version of glmatrix (2.0). Push&Pop matrix just like in opengles 1.1. First level of customisation is texture part of code. Best view in example custom_texture.js. I implemented webcam quick access call with custom active texture (porting canvas2d to the 3d faces works fine).
